# K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze and group data into clusters based on their similarities. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for pattern recognition, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm
- Selection of optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Visualization of clustered data
- Performance evaluation

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the notebook.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize features if needed).
3. Apply the K-Means algorithm.
4. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
5. Visualize the clustering results.

## Dataset
The notebook is designed to work with structured datasets containing numerical features. If using a custom dataset, ensure it is formatted correctly.

## Results
After execution, the notebook will output:
- Clustered data points visualization
- Optimal number of clusters based on the Elbow Method
- Performance evaluation metrics
